I've helped launch over 50 Shopify stores in recent years. Some generate thousands of dollars monthly, others barely survive. The difference isn't in the product—it's in how the store is built.

## Why Shopify Remains the Best Choice

In a market full of options (WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce), Shopify dominates for one simple reason: it works. You don't need to be technical to use it, but it has all the power a developer needs.

### Key Shopify Advantages

- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
- **Speed**: Globally optimized servers
- **Ecosystem**: Thousands of apps and themes
- **Support**: 24/7 in multiple languages

## Mistakes That Kill New Stores

### 1. Low-Quality Product Photos

Your customers can't touch the product. Photos are your only salesperson. Invest in good images or simply don't sell.

### 2. Copied Manufacturer Descriptions

Google penalizes duplicate content. Your customers get bored with generic descriptions. Write your own descriptions that sell.

### 3. Complicated Checkout Process

Every extra click reduces your conversions. Shopify Checkout is excellent by default—don't ruin it with unnecessary apps.

## Technical Configuration You Can't Ignore

```liquid
{% comment %}
  Example snippet to show discount
{% endcomment %}

{% if product.compare_at_price > product.price %}
  <span class="sale-badge">
    -{{ product.compare_at_price | minus: product.price | times: 100 | divided_by: product.compare_at_price }}%
  </span>
{% endif %}
```

### SEO From Day One

- Clean, descriptive URLs
- Optimized meta titles
- Product schema markup
- Automatic sitemap

### Loading Speed

- Optimize images (WebP when possible)
- Minimize installed apps
- Use well-optimized themes

## Apps You Actually Need

| App | Purpose | Free? |
|-----|---------|-------|
| Klaviyo | Email marketing | Yes (up to 250 contacts) |
| Judge.me | Reviews | Yes (basic) |
| Shogun | Page builder | No |

## Launch Strategy

1. **Week 1-2**: Basic configuration
2. **Week 3**: Add products
3. **Week 4**: Checkout testing
4. **Week 5**: Soft launch
5. **Week 6+**: Marketing and optimization

## The Secret Nobody Tells You

E-commerce success isn't about having the prettiest store. It's about understanding your customer better than anyone else.

> "People don't buy products. They buy solutions to their problems."

Study your competition, talk to your customers, and improve constantly.
