When I started web development, PHP ruled the world. Then came jQuery, then Angular, React, and now Next.js has become my favorite tool. Let me explain why.

## What Makes Next.js Special?

Next.js is a React framework created by Vercel that elegantly solves the most common problems in modern web development.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

```typescript
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
export default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
  const post = await getPost(params.slug);
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <div>{post.content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

Content is rendered on the server, which means:
- Better SEO
- Faster initial load
- Consistent experience

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

For pages that don't change frequently, you can pre-render them at build time:

```typescript
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getAllPosts();
  
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}
```

## Comparison with Other Frameworks

| Feature | Next.js | Create React App | Gatsby |
|---------|---------|------------------|--------|
| SSR | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| SSG | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| API Routes | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| ISR | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Learning Curve | Medium | Low | Medium |

## The New App Router

Next.js 14+ introduced the App Router, which fundamentally changes how we structure our applications:

### Server Components by Default

Components are now server-side by default, reducing JavaScript sent to the client.

### Nested Layouts

```
app/
├── layout.tsx       # Root layout
├── page.tsx         # Home page
└── blog/
    ├── layout.tsx   # Blog layout
    └── page.tsx     # Post list
```

### Streaming and Suspense

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Dashboard</h1>
      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>
        <SlowComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Ideal Use Cases

1. **E-commerce**: Product pages with SSR for SEO
2. **Blogs**: Static content with SSG
3. **Dashboards**: Interactive apps with Server Components
4. **Landing pages**: Optimized performance

## When NOT to Use Next.js?

- Mobile apps (use React Native)
- Very simple single-page projects
- If your team doesn't know React

## My Favorite Stack with Next.js

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase or PlanetScale
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel (obviously)
- **CMS**: Sanity or Contentful
